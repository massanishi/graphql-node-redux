# graphql-node-redux
It is a simple example to demonstrate how to use graphql into an Express/Node/Sequelize in the backendend and Redux/React in the front.

## To use
Run `npm run build` for the front end, and `npm run server` to start a node server.

*Note*

Every time node restarts, it creates mock a user and client data with sqlLite.
